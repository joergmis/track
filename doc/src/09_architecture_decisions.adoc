== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR1: skipping ID for events

==== Context

For the event sourcing, events need to be generated. To be able to tell them
apart, some sort of unique identification is needed.

==== Decision

Use the timestamp of when the event is generated as identifier. Since the
application is focused on a single user, this is sufficient. If activities are
syncronised to backends, they will their own identifier.

==== Consequences

If the application is used by multiple users, by chance, you might time it
exactly so that two activities have the same timestamp and therefore are not
uniquely identifiable.
